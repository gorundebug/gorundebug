👋 Hi, I’m @gorundebug
👀 I’m interested in microservices architecture, code generation, and streamlining the development process for complex IT solutions.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced concepts in multi-language microservices and the integration of stream processing paradigms.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools that facilitate the automated generation of microservice architectures and help reduce boilerplate code in enterprise projects.
📫 How to reach me: serlex777@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I'm constantly exploring new ways to integrate functional programming paradigms into microservices development.
